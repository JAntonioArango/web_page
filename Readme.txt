Functional Requirements

Dark Mode Toggle
Users can easily switch between light and dark themes on any page. The website remembers their preference, so it’s consistent across all pages and even when they revisit the site.

Image Carousel
A rotating carousel on the homepage showcases images of bearings, automatically transitioning every 2 seconds. (We could also add a manual pause button later if needed.)

Navigation Menu
A clear navigation bar lets users quickly move between the Home, Catalogues, and Contact pages. It also highlights the current page to make navigation easier.

Responsive Design
The website is responsive and works smoothly on all devices, from desktop computers to tablets and smartphones. Content and navigation adjust for the best experience on any screen size.

Contact Form
Visitors can fill out a form to get in touch, providing their name, country, and a message. There’s also a "Submit" button for easy interaction, even though it’s just a placeholder for now.


Non-Functional Requirements

Quick Loading Times
The website should load fast—ideally within 2 seconds on a standard internet connection. Users shouldn’t have to wait long to access content or interact with features.

User-Friendly Experience
The layout and navigation should be intuitive and easy to understand. Buttons and links need to stand out clearly, so visitors know exactly where to click.

Browser and Device Compatibility
The site must work seamlessly on all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It should also look and function properly on both desktop and mobile devices.
